I am a final-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with a strong foundation in programming languages
 like C, C++, Java, and C#. I have hands-on experience in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
 along with knowledge of SQL for database handling. My academic background includes core computer science
 subjects such as DBMS, OOPs, and Data Structures & Algorithms. I am currently focused on becoming a confident
 frontend developer while preparing for technical interviews through consistent DSA problem-solving and practical
 project work.
